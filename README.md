# Task 15 – End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline

## Objective
Build a complete ML pipeline with preprocessing, training, evaluation, and model saving.

## Dataset
Breast Cancer Dataset from sklearn.

## Steps Performed
- Loaded dataset and separated features and target
- Applied scaling using ColumnTransformer
- Built ML pipeline using Pipeline
- Trained model and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Saved trained pipeline as .pkl file

## Outcome
Understood real-world end-to-end ML workflow used in production systems.
